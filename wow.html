  <title>this is very similar to python, i think i should use this one more</title>
  <title>i like webstorm a lot more than i like atom</title>
  <title>hi so i'm going to try to push this one onto github as well</title>
  <title>wow so this really worked</title>

<body>
<p>so i'm going to try and upload this one again</p>
<p>update after the commit and push, this is how you set it to github for it to be placed
  into a repo to then be view by anyone who has acess to that repo</p>
<p>i'm i'm going to try to merge onto github and see if that offically updates things
i think it's nice that they have a button that updates everything</p>
<p>okay so that didn't work LMAO i realize the only way to get onto git is by pushing and committing </p>
